Let us assume, that $C' \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2^n\\times 2^n}$ can be decomposed into $m$ Pauli strings. Then, by the Kronecker graph definition, $C$ can be decomposed into $m^N$ while the total number of Pauli strings necessary to decompose an arbitrary matrix of size $2^{nN} \\times 2^{nN}$ is $4^{nN}$. Thus $$\\alpha = \\left(\\frac{m}{4^n}\\right)^N$$, i.e. the number of Pauli strings is exponentially suppressed."
